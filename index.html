     <section id="education and struggles">
        <h2>Education and Struggles</h2>
        <p>Kalam was extremely earnest and diligent in his studies, but his teachers recognised him as having a tremendous desire to study. He finished his secondary studies at Ramanathapuram’s Schwartz Secondary School. In 1955, he graduated from Saint Joseph’s College at Tiruchirappalli with a diploma in physics. He subsequently went to Madras to further his education, graduating from the Engineering And Technology Institute with a diploma in aircraft engineering. His dream of becoming a military pilot was crushed when the IAF only had eight slots available, and he finished ninth. Following graduation, he worked as a scientist for the “Defense Research Service” and the “Aeronautical Development Establishment.”</p>

        <h2>Scientist</h2>
        <p>On graduation from the University of Madras in 1960, APJ Abdul Kalam returned to the Defence Research and Development organisation Organisation as a scientist (DRDO). He began his career by creating a tiny hovercraft, however his position with the DRDO did not persuade him. APJ Abdul Kalam was moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969 as the project head of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle, which successfully launched the Rohini satellite into relatively near orbit in July 1980.

Raja Ramanna also invited APJ Abdul Kalam to see the country’s first nuclear test, Laughing Buddha, as the spokesman of TBRL. However, he had never participated in its development.</p>

        <h2>Presidency</h2>
        <p>Sir Kalam was the rightful 11th Indian President. His presidency lasted from July 25, 2002, to July 25, 2007. He was elected with a huge margin of victory in a presidential election in 2002. The National Democratic Alliances’ nomination for President was endorsed by the Samajwadi Party and the National Congress Party. He was often referred to as the people’s President because of his numerous contributions to the well-being of the people and the country. He was daring and brave enough to make and implement difficult, delicate, or contentious judgments. Perhaps the most difficult Act he had to sign was the “office of profit.” Under the English Settlement Act of 1701 in 1701, the “office of profit” indicates that no one individual who is a professional setup process underneath the royal family or who has any arrangement with or is receiving a pension from the prince does have the ability to work for the “House of Commons.” This will give the royal family no influence on administrative conditions.</p>
